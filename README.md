It includes variables such as clicks, cost per click, date, expenditure, revenue, campaign name, product code, and other relevant marketing metrics. This dataset is designed to simulate real-world marketing data and serves as the foundation for analyzing marketing trends and performance metrics. Through thorough analysis of this dataset, meaningful insights will be extracted to create an informative and actionable marketing trend dashboard.

This visualization enables stakeholders to compare the performance of different campaigns in terms of expenditure and revenue generation. Notably, the analysis reveals that campaign 68 has the highest spend and sales, indicating its significant impact on overall performance.

### Display of Spend and Sales by Date:
Once again, a column bar chart has been utilized to depict the expenditure and sales figures over various dates. This visualization facilitates a clear understanding of the spending and sales trends over time, allowing stakeholders to identify patterns and make informed decisions accordingly.

### Spend and Sales by Product Code:
For this analysis, a bar chart has been employed to showcase the spend and sales figures associated with different product codes. This visualization highlights the distribution of expenditure and revenue across various product categories.
